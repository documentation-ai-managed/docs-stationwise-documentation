You integrate scheduling with training calendars to avoid conflicts during drills. The platform predicts staffing needs based on historical call volumes. Generate what-if scenarios to test coverage under different conditions.

For multi-station departments, you view aggregated schedules. Set global rules, like maximum consecutive shifts, to comply with NFPA standards. Firefighters access their schedules via the app, requesting swaps that route to supervisors.

<CodeGroup tabs="API,CLI">
  ```javascript
  // Fetch upcoming shifts
  fetch('/api/schedules/upcoming', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}` }
  }).then(res => res.json()).then(data => {
    updateCalendar(data);
  });
  ```
  ```bash
  # Create a new shift via CLI
  stationwise shifts create --start "2024-10-20T08:00" --end "2024-10-21T08:00" --role captain --station central
  ```
