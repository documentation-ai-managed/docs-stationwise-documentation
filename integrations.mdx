You monitor integration health via status indicators. Troubleshoot failed syncs with detailed logs. For custom setups, the API supports webhooks for events like shift changes.

Extend functionality by integrating with calendar apps for personal schedules. Ensure compliance by syncing training records to certification databases. The platform handles conflicts, like duplicate entries, automatically.
